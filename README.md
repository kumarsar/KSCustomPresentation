# KSCustomPresentation

The KSCustomPresentation presents a viewController which can of different sizes and from different directions.

If we are presenting controller B from controller A which is half the size of A. Then, we can still have controller A
visible behind controller B with half transparency.
The presentation can happen from multiple directions i.e, from bottom/right.

This can be a replacement for the default presentation which in normal scenario covers full screen.
